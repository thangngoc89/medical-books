				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The growth of implant and fixed prosthodontics practices in dentistry has created a rapidly increasing demand for advanced ceramics and ceramic processes. Innovations in ceramics and ceramic processes are vital to ensure reliable and affordable dental-restoration solutions with aesthetically pleasing outcomes.</p>
<p>The work aims to engage the bioceramics and engineering communities to meet the challenges of modern dental restoration using advanced ceramics. Incorporating fundamental science, advanced engineering concepts, and clinical outcomes, the work is suitable for bioceramicists, ceramics manufacturers, dental clinicians and biologists.</p>
<ul>
<li>State-of-the-art-coverage encompasses bioresorbable ceramics for bone regeneration and bioactivating surfaces of inert, high-strength ceramics for implantation, keeping research knowledge appropriately updated</li>
<li>Discusses transition from the baseline stable and physically stiff ceramics research into engineering of highly coherent laminate composites for prosthetic crowns and bridges</li>
<li>Showcases current feasible techniques for producing, in cost-effective and materials-saving ways, long-lasting individualized ceramic components with biocompatibility, complexity and high precision</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive endodontics reference, <b>Cohen‚Äôs Pathways of the Pulp</b> is known for its comprehensive coverage of leading-edge information, materials, and techniques. It examines all aspects of endodontic care, from preparing the clinician and patient for endodontic treatment to the role the endodontist can play in the treatment of traumatic injuries and to the procedures used in the treatment of pediatric and older patients. Not only does Hargreaves and Cohen‚Äôs 10th edition add five chapters on hot new topics, it also includes online access! As an Expert Consult title,<b>Cohen‚Äôs Pathways of the Pulp</b> lets you search the entire contents of the book on your computer, and includes five online chapters not available in the printed text, plus videos, a searchable image collection, and more. For evidence-based endodontics research and treatment, this is your one-stop resource!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A diverse and respected group of contributors</b> includes experts such as Louis Berman, Gerald Glickman, Richard Walton, Gary Hartwell, and many more.</li>
<li><b><i>Preparation for Treatment</i> chapter</b> examines the issues that must be addressed before nonsurgical root canal treatment can begin, including proper infection control and occupational safety procedures for the entire health care team and treatment environment, appropriate communication with the patient (including case presentation and informed consent), premedication, effective administration of local anesthesia, a quality radiographic or digital-image survey, and thorough isolation of the treatment site.</li>
<li><b><i>Cleaning and Shaping of the Root Canal System</i></b> <b>chapter</b> includes a new section on preventing/treating sodium hypochlorite accidents, and also addresses the framework of root canal treatment, the technical and clinical issues surrounding cleaning and shaping, and canal preparation and cleaning techniques.</li>
<li><b><i>Records and Legal Responsibilities</i> chapter</b> includes legal forms and descriptions of legal processes, guidelines for record keeping, and information on HIPAA doctor-patient rights and responsibilities, so you can avoid potential legal issues, operate your practice more smoothly and professionally, and know your options in all situations.</li>
<li><b><i>The Role of Endodontics After Dental Traumatic Injuries</i> chapter</b> focuses on the role of the dentino-pulpal complex in the pathogenesis of disease subsequent to dentinal trauma and how treatment of this complex can contribute to favorable healing.</li>
<li><b><i>Periradicular Surgery</i> chapter</b> covers this predictable, cost-effective alternative to extraction and tooth replacement with a new section on three-dimensional cone beam volumetric tomography and also covers topics including indications for periradicular surgery, the biological principles of wound healing, soft and hard tissue healing, systemic medications and the effect they have on wound healing, pre-operative evaluation, patient preparation, anesthesia, surgical access, periradicular curettage and biopsy, localized hemostasis, management of the root endguided tissue regeneration and endodontic surgery, intentional replantation, postoperative care, management of surgical complications, and more.</li>
<li><b><i>Pediatric Endodontics</i> chapter</b> provides a review of current therapies for the prevention and treatment of pulpal disease in primary and young permanent teeth.</li>
<li><b><i>Effects of Age and Systemic Health on Endodontics</i> chapter</b> discusses special considerations and procedures for older patients, including how medical and dental histories can impact treatment, diagnosis and treatment of the older patient, and endodontic surgery.</li>
<li><b><i>Digital Technology in Endodontic Practice</i> chapter</b> discusses integrating technology into the office, including the use of electronic records, with a new section on radiation addressing the NCRP recommendations, quality assurance, and patient education, and a section on Cone Beam CT examining CBCT advantages such as lower cost, less radiation, and greater accuracy, along with the newly introduced hybrid units like the Kodak 9000 3D extraoral imaging system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Online access</b> to the complete, fully searchable contents of the book makes it easy to find clinical answers quickly.</li>
<li><b>Five chapters are available online only</b>: <i>Understanding and Managing the Fearful Dental Patient, The Law and Dental Technology: Focus on Endodontics, Digital Technologies in Endodontic Practice, CBCT for Endodontics, </i>and<i> Endodontic Practice Management.</i></li>
<li><b>Updates</b> address the latest developments in the field.</li>
<li><b>Videos and animations</b> demonstrate key procedures, such as palpation of the masseter muscle, introsseous anesthesia with the X-tip‚Ñ¢ system, dentin hypersensitivity, indirect ultrasound, palpation of the temporomandibular joint, ultrasonic settling, and more.</li>
<li><b>An online image library</b> includes all of the book‚Äôs images, organized by chapter, in a user-friendly format &#8211; allowing you to search for what you want and then save images into a virtual &#8220;Light Box&#8221; or straight into a PowerPoint presentation.</li>
<li><b>NEW <i>Pathobiology of the Periapex</i> chapter</b> covers apical periodontitis and infection, asymptomatic apical periodontitis (apical granuloma), infection apical periodontitis and systemic diseases, wound healing of apical periodontitis, and much more.</li>
<li><b>NEW <i>Restoration of Endodontically Treated Teeth</i> chapter</b> covers topics such as the special features of endodontically treated teeth, restorative materials, pretreatment evaluation and treatment strategy, and a variety of clinical procedures including direct composite restorations, veneers, amalgam core, composite core and white post, and more.</li>
<li><b>NEW <i>Regenerative Endodontics</i> chapter</b>.</li>
<li><b>NEW <i>CBCT for Endodontics</i> chapter</b>.</li>
<li><b>NEW <i>Endodontic Practice Management</i> chapter</b>.</li>
<li><b>A drug database</b> &#8211; powered by Gold Standard &#8211; lets you access drug information by indications, contraindications, and adverse reactions.</li>
<li><b>A <i>Challenge</i></b> lets you assess your understanding with multiple-choice questions based on chapter-specific discussions or case scenarios, including answers and rationales.</li>
<li><b>A glossary</b> defines evidence-based terms, as provided by <i>The Journal of Evidence-Based Dental Practice</i></li>
