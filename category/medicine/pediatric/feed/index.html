				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The landmark pediatrics reference &#8212; now extensively updated in full color and more clinically relevant than ever</b></p>
<p><b>A Doody&#8217;s Core Title for 2015!</b></p>
<p><i>Rudolph&#8217;s Pediatrics</i> has virtually defined the pediatric field for over a century, becoming one of the most important and well-respected pediatrics texts ever published. Renowned for its balance of clinical features and treatment of disease with underlying biological principles, this classic sourcebook has helped generations of pediatricians optimize their care of infants, children, and adolescents.<br />
The 22nd edition of <i>Rudolph&#8217;s Pediatrics</i> continues a long tradition of adapting its content to changes in our understanding of children&#8217;s health and disease, providing an up-to-date, in-depth survey of pediatric medicine unmatched by any other text. With its algorithmic approach to pediatric systems, the book facilitates the diagnosis and treatment of both common and uncommon pediatric illnesses; and it reflects new technologies and advances in molecular medicine that continue to evolve with current thinking about normal childhood development and pediatric disease processes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated and revised to reflect recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances, this popular quick reference guide provides the practical knowledge needed to diagnose and manage children with congenital and acquired heart disease. It explains whether the patient should be referred to a pediatric cardiologist or managed by the primary care practitioner. It also features the latest blood pressure measuring techniques, new recommendations by the National Committee on infective endocarditis prophylaxis, cardiovascular manifestations of HIV infection, and includes pediatric drug dosage tables.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This is a wonderful and extremely useful teaching guide and clinical tool&#8230;surpasses all other books on this topic in its goal of providing practical information to primary care practitioners. The new edition is justified for many reasons. Surgical techniques have changed since the last edition, and Dr. Park has updated this section extensively. The treatment of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension has also been updated nicely. The new chapters on palpitations and athletes with cardiac problems are also extremely useful. The updates, as well as Dr. Park&#8217;s personal and logical advice on topics such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, make this book the logical resource for primary care clinicians</p>
