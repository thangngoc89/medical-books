<p>The book is written for the clinical skills subject of the medical curriculum. Medical schools teach this at varying stages, some introducing the subject in the beginning years (graduate medical schools years 1 &amp; 2) and others at year 3 (traditional/hybrid curricula, usually 5 or 6 years). Specialty Colleges and RACP teach a clinical skills subject in the early part of basic training which takes place after PGY1 &amp; 2.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A classic text, <b>Chamberlain&#8217;s Symptoms and Signs in Clinical Medicine</b> has been providing students and professionals with a detailed and well-illustrated account of the symptoms and signs of diseases affecting all the body systems since the first edition published in 1936. Now completely rewritten by a new team of authors selected for their experience and reputation in writing quality publications in their specialist fields, the 13th edition brings the title into line with current teaching and practice.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges of writing a textbook of diagnostic medicine is to balance the &#8220;bottom up&#8221; approach of constructing a differential diagnosis from individual clinical findings, and the &#8220;top down&#8221; approach of learning the key features pertaining to a particular diagnosis. The 13th edition of <b>Chamberlain&#8217;s Symptoms and Signs in Clinical Medicine</b> integrates both approaches into a coherent working framework that will assist the reader in preparing for academic and professional examinations, and in everyday practice.</p>
<p>Presented in full colour and illustrated with relevant images, this book provides a thorough lesson in diagnostic medicine, ensuring the reader is fully prepared to deal with the challenging process of differential diagnosis through a thorough knowledge of the central features of the conditions that they are likely to encounter.</p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaches the reader how to diagnose correctly through assessment of symptoms and signs while simultaneously recalling all key features of a given condition</li>
<li>Full colour and generously illustrated</li>
<li>Conforms with the core competencies required for the foundation years</li>
<li>Includes bullet point lists and tip boxes</li>
<li>Chapters conclude with a summary of key points for easy revision</li>
<li>Written and edited by a highly experienced team of specialists</li>
<li>Companion website</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This best-selling undergraduate textbook provides an introduction to key experimental techniques from across the biosciences. It uniquely integrates the theories and practices that drive the fields of biology and medicine, comprehensively covering both the methods students will encounter in lab classes and those that underpin recent advances and discoveries. Its problem-solving approach continues with worked examples that set a challenge and then show students how the challenge is met. New to this edition are case studies, for example, that illustrate the relevance of the principles and techniques to the diagnosis and treatment of individual patients. Coverage is expanded to include a section on stem cells, chapters on immunochemical techniques and spectroscopy techniques, and additional chapters on drug discovery and development, and clinical biochemistry. Experimental design and the statistical analysis of data are emphasised throughout to ensure students are equipped to successfully plan their own experiments and examine the results obtained.</p>
<div class="contentHidden">
<ul class="academicArrowList">
<li>Motivates students by including cutting-edge topics and techniques, such as drug discovery, as well as the methods they will encounter in their own lab classes</li>
<li>Promotes problem solving by setting students a challenge and then guiding them through the solution</li>
<li>Integrates theory and practice to ensure students understand why and how each technique is used</li>
</ul>
