				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 1927, <b><i>Goldman’s Cecil Medicine</i></b> has been the world’s most influential internal medicine reference. Edited by Lee Goldman, MD and Andrew I. Schafer, MD, with associate editors and contributors who number among the most recognized and respected authorities in the field, <b><i>Cecil</i></b> continues to set the standard for all other resources of its kind. This dynamic, multi-media reference &#8211; with its practical, straight-forward style, accessible organization, evidence-ranked references, and robust online content &#8211; is quite simply <b>the fastest and best place</b> to find all of the <b>authoritative, state-of-the-art clinical answers</b> you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Stay on the cutting edge</b> with <b>updates personally selected by Dr. Lee Goldman</b> and regularly integrated directly into each chapter online. More than <b>400 updates</b> have been made since publication.</li>
<li><b>Simplify and expedite decision making</b> with practical, well-organized, templated chapters that include evidence-ranked references and algorithms to make clinically essential information leap right off the page.</li>
<li><b>Access the fully searchable text online</b> anywhere, anytime at <b>www.expertconsult.com</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Stay current with the latest knowledge and evidence-based practices</b>. Comprehensive updates throughout include a brand-new chapter on &#8220;Applications of Molecular Technologies to Clinical Medicine,&#8221; a completely revamped section on infectious diseases, and coverage of the very latest cardiovascular techniques and treatments.</li>
<li><b>Be certain </b>with <b>expert, dependable, accurate answers</b> from Dr. Goldman and an editorial team that is <b>a veritable &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; of modern medicine</b> &#8211; including Jeffrey Drazen, MD, Editor-in-Chief of the New England Journal of Medicine and new associate editor Wendy Levinson, MD, 2009-2010 Chair of the Board of Directors of the American Board of Internal Medicine. Almost all contributors currently hold positions as Chairs of Internal Medicine departments around the U.S. and Canada and all are at the forefront of their respective subspecialty areas.</li>
<li><b>Reference information more quickly</b> thanks to a new, streamlined print format and easily searchable online access to supplemental figures, tables, algorithms, additional references, and expanded discussions as well as procedural videos, Seldom Asked Questions, and case studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cecil &#8211; the best internal medicine resource available since 1927 &#8211; far exceeds the competition in versatility, ease-of-use and up-to-datedness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated and revised to reflect recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances, this popular quick reference guide provides the practical knowledge needed to diagnose and manage children with congenital and acquired heart disease. It explains whether the patient should be referred to a pediatric cardiologist or managed by the primary care practitioner. It also features the latest blood pressure measuring techniques, new recommendations by the National Committee on infective endocarditis prophylaxis, cardiovascular manifestations of HIV infection, and includes pediatric drug dosage tables.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This is a wonderful and extremely useful teaching guide and clinical tool&#8230;surpasses all other books on this topic in its goal of providing practical information to primary care practitioners. The new edition is justified for many reasons. Surgical techniques have changed since the last edition, and Dr. Park has updated this section extensively. The treatment of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension has also been updated nicely. The new chapters on palpitations and athletes with cardiac problems are also extremely useful. The updates, as well as Dr. Park&#8217;s personal and logical advice on topics such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, make this book the logical resource for primary care clinicians</p>
