				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This CD-ROM provides an interactive database of human anatomy, with the emphasis on clinical and functional relevance. Based on the texts &#8220;Colour Atlas of Human Anatomy&#8221; and &#8220;Functional and Clinical Anatomy&#8221;, it illustrates key functions by using video clips and animated graphics. Some features of anatomy, such as the skeleton and other parts of the body, are included in 3-D by MRI; and anatomy can be studied by system or region, or both, in this interactive programme. Interactive tests are included for all stills in the programme, as well as Peter Abraham&#8217;s Cambridge anatomy worksheets, which include core questions on every region of the body. There is a zoom facility for close study and highlighting interesting structures.</p>

<p>As always my endevour to help medical fraternity continues. Requests are welcome.</p>
<p>Please seed.</p>
<p>Solutions to common problems:<br />
README for McMinn\&#8217;s 3-D Anatomy<br />
Listed below are solutions to known problems which may occur<br />
installing or running the application.</p>
<p>(REF: LOWCLR)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: The installation displays a warning that the<br />
application may not run correctly using the current display<br />
settings.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This application requires that your display settings<br />
are set to at least 800 x 600 and with more than 256 colors. To<br />
change these settings on your machine proceed as follows:</p>
<p>From the Start button, choose &#8220;Settings&#8221; and &#8220;Control Panel&#8221;.<br />
This will bring up a list of controls, from which you should<br />
choose the &#8220;Display&#8221; option. This brings up the Display<br />
Properties panel. Click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab to show the<br />
current settings for the numbers of colours, desktop size and<br />
font size. Ensure the &#8220;Color Palette&#8221; setting is set to a value<br />
greater than 256 (eg. &#8220;65536 colors&#8221;, &#8220;High Color&#8221;, &#8220;16 bit&#8221; or<br />
&#8220;True Color&#8221;. Use the &#8220;Desktop Area&#8221; slider to ensure that it<br />
is set to at least &#8220;800 by 600 pixels&#8221;. You can use the &#8220;Test&#8221;<br />
button to check your selection. Click on &#8220;Close&#8221; when you have<br />
finished.</p>
<p>(REF: ADMPRIV)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: The installation displays a message indicating<br />
&#8220;administrator privileges&#8221; are required.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: The installer has to make changes to the system which,<br />
when running under Windows NT, can only be made by a user with<br />
administrator privileges. The installer must be run again when a<br />
user with administrator privileges is logged-on. Once installed<br />
the application can be used by any user.</p>
<p>(REF: COMCTRL)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: When the application is run it displays a warning that<br />
a system update is required.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This application requires a recent version of a<br />
Microsoft system file called &#8220;Comctl32.dll&#8221; to be installed. The<br />
installer checks for this file and should prompt the user to<br />
install the &#8220;COMCTL32.DLL&#8221; update. However if for any reason the<br />
user skipped this part of the installation or it did not<br />
complete correctly then it can be installed manually.</p>
<p>The update can be installed either by installing a recent<br />
version of Microsoft Internet Explorer (4.01 SP2 or later) or by<br />
running the Microsoft update program &#8220;401comupd.exe&#8221; which is<br />
supplied with this application.</p>
<p>To run the update program:</p>
<p>* Ensure the application CDROM is in the drive.</p>
<p>* Close the application if it is already running.</p>
<p>* From the &#8220;Start&#8221; button menu, select &#8220;Run&#8230;&#8221; and type<br />
&#8220;\\setup\\401cmupd.exe&#8221; and press RETURN (assuming D is your<br />
CD-ROM drive). Follow the on-screen instructions to install the<br />
update.</p>
<p>Below are the notes supplied by Microsoft for running this<br />
update:</p>
<p>You can use the file 401comupd.exe to install Comctl32.dll<br />
(version 4.72.3611.1900) on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows<br />
NT 4.0. You cannot use 401comupd.exe for Windows 3.x, Windows<br />
for Workgroups 3.x, Windows NT 3.x, Windows 98 SE, or Windows<br />
2000. Do not attempt to run 401comupd.exe on any system with<br />
Internet Explorer 5.x installed. You must install Service Pack 3<br />
or later on Windows NT 4.0 before installing 401comupd.exe. As<br />
with all operating system changes, administrator privileges are<br />
required to use 401comupd.exe on Windows NT 4.0.</p>
<p>(note that the file 401comupd.exe has been renamed to<br />
401cmupd.exe on the CD because of filename restrictions)</p>
<p>At the time of writing the latest version of this update is<br />
available for download at<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp.</p>
<p>(REF: NTSP3)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: I\&#8217;m running Windows NT 4 and the installation fails<br />
with a message indicating that I need to install &#8220;Service Pack<br />
3&#8221;.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This application will only run on Windows NT 4 if<br />
Service Pack 3 or later has been installed.</p>
<p>Please contact Microsoft to obtain the latest Service Pack. This<br />
can usually be downloaded free of charge from their web site.<br />
Some computer magazines also supply it on their cover-mounted<br />
CDs.</p>
<p>(REF: APPSETUP)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: When the application is run it displays a message<br />
indicating it cannot find a file called &#8220;appsetup.txt&#8221;.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This indicates that for some reason the application<br />
data files (which normally reside on the supplied CD) cannot be<br />
accessed. This could occur if the CD is not in the drive or if<br />
the drive letter of the CD drive has changed since the<br />
application was last run.</p>
<p>Click on &#8220;OK&#8221; to dismiss this message and a window is displayed<br />
which will allow the location of the file to be selected.<br />
Navigate to the folder containing &#8220;appsetup.txt&#8221; and click OK.<br />
Note that the &#8220;appsetup.txt&#8221; file is normally within a folder<br />
called &#8220;shared&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Gray’s Atlas of Anatomy</i></b>, the companion resource to the popular <b><i>Gray&#8217;s Anatomy for Students, </i></b>presents a vivid, visual depiction of anatomical structures. Newly updated with a wealth of material to facilitate study, this medical textbook <b>demonstrates the correlation of structures with appropriate clinical images and surface anatomy</b> &#8211; essential for proper identification in the dissection lab and successful preparation for course exams. Clinically focused, consistently and clearly illustrated throughout, and logically organized, <b><i>Gray&#8217;s Atlas of Anatomy</i></b> makes it easier than ever to master the essential anatomy knowledge you need!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Build on your existing anatomy knowledge</b> with structures presented from a superficial to deep orientation, representing a logical progression through the body.</li>
<li><b>Identify the various anatomical structures of the body</b> and <b>better understand their relationships to each other </b>with the visual guidance of nearly 1,000 exquisitely illustrated anatomical figures.</li>
<li><b>Visualize the clinical correlation between anatomical structures and surface landmarks</b> with surface anatomy photographs overlaid with anatomical drawings.</li>
<li><b>Recognize anatomical structures as they present in practice</b> through more than 270 clinical images &#8211; including laparoscopic, radiologic, surgical, ophthalmoscopic, otoscopic, and other clinical views &#8211; placed adjacent to anatomic artwork for side-by-side comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quickly access and review key information</b> with more clinical correlations, in addition to new Summary Tables at the end of each chapter that cover relevant muscles, nerves, and arteries.</li>
<li><b>Gain a full understanding of cranial nerves </b>through a brand-new <b>Cranial Nerve Review</b> section that offers a visual guide of the nerves, a table of reflexes, and an additional table of nerve lesions.</li>
<li><b>Access the complete contents, </b>dissection video clips, and self-assessment questions online at <b>Student</b><b>Consult.com.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;a collection of beautifully drawn anatomical illustrations; each clearly labelled allowing for easy identification of the various structures&#8230;an excellent, pictorial anatomy guide for medical students learning anatomy for the first time whether they&#8217;re in the dissection room or as part of their private study.&#8221; <i>UK Medical Student</i><b>BMA Book Awards 2008 &#8211; Highly Commended</b>&#8220;The quality of the artistic illustrations is high with some being particularly clear and helpful. This is a valuable and welcome addition to the anatomy world which any student of the subject will find a valuable resource to support their learning and understanding of the complexity of the human body.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a companion resource to the popular Gray’s Anatomy for Students. It in you will find accurate and clear depictions of the anatomy of eight regions of our bodies. This extensive and intensive atlas of over 600 pages provides detailed full-color drawings of anatomical structures, and images obtained through computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) technologies. Many of the CT images were taken with contrast, so they present the anatomy in question much more clearly than would be possible in simple CT depictions. Gray’s Atlas of Anatomy, second edition is an excellent resource for students and teachers of human anatomy. The fact that so much additional information is available and interaction is possible online makes it a truly outstanding, highly valuable product. ~Nano Khilnani</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;In short, the 40th edition of <b><i>Gray&#8217;s Anatomy</i></b> is not only the most complete textbook of anatomy on the market but is possibly the most complete anatomical atlas available.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>JAMA</b></i>, May 6, 2009&#8211;Vol 301, No. 17, pp. 1829-1830.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not aware of any book currently in print in any language that contains as much anatomical information as the 40th edition. it should be in the library of anyone who has the need for a comprehensive anatomical reference book. It may seem costly, but, per pound, it really is a bargain. Many books on the market offer much, much less but cost much more.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>JAMA</b></i>, May 6, 2009&#8211;Vol 301, No. 17, pp. 1829-1830.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most valuable aspects of <b><i>Gray&#8217;s</i></b> is the way it integrates structure at all levels, from the subcellular through the regional.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>JAMA</b></i>, May 6, 2009&#8211;Vol 301, No. 17, pp. 1829-1830.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Gray&#8217;s Anatomy] is to medical textbooks what Webster&#8217;s is to dictionaries.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>American Medical News</b></i>, Posted Jan. 12, 2009 at amednews.com &#8220;Each section has been reorganized by an editor, expert in the field, assisted by a group of contributors, and scrutinized by a panel of international reviewers. Anatomists, embryologists, cell biologists, surgeons, radiologists and other clinicians have brought their extensive experience to update the text and artwork. Moreover, essential and recent references are given at the end of each chapter of the different sections. The result is a well-documented and clinically-oriented state-of-the-art volume&#8230;The presentation of the book is practical and attractive&#8230;To sum up, this new 150th anniversary edition of <i>Gray’s Anatomy</i>, which is the first one in full-colour, is quite simply a magnificent work.&#8221; <b><i>Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy, November 2008</i></b> &#8220;The all-important tradition of improvement with age is most emphatically maintained by the newest edition of Gray&#8217;s Anatomy . . . New and important ground has been broken . . . The authors have increasingly taken on the task of accommodating the new uses to which anatomy is being put in clinical situations, such as minimally invasive surgery, endoscopy, arthroscopy, microsurgery, and the entire expanding field of imaging, including three-dimensional studies . . . Beautifully produced and medically invaluable.&#8221; &#8211; Scientific American, review of the 39th edition Gray’s Anatomy has been around since 1858. In 2008, Elsevier can be proud of the first class presentation of this updated, fabulous book. It has been completely re-imagined with re-organised contents and 1800 images now in full-colour, in addition to more than 120 new imaging studies. For those who need a detailed anatomy reference, this book is the business and it’s the only one you’ll ever need. <b>Unividas Review, January 2009</b></p>
<p>&#8220;This book has really excellent content. It’s the first point of call for a query, better than standard textbooks. Good authorage and editorial input is evident. A new edition of Gray’s always has to live up to its historical place in the medical world. The new edition updates content, is well presented, readable and accurate. This is supported by quality illustrations. A book for those wanting a reference source for anatomy which is reliable and current.&#8221; <i><b>BMA Book Awards 2009 &#8211; judges comments</b></i></p>
<p>&#8220;The new edition of Gray’s Anatomy has been edited by a highly regarded group of clinicians and anatomists, with support from hundreds of contributors and specialist reviewers worldwide. The reader gets enhanced and updated artwork throughout the text’s 2,000 images that utilise full colour and provide a consistent, coherent view of every anatomical detail. It provides every practitioner with the best, most clinically helpful, visual understanding of the subject available. It was a pleasure to review this exceptional and unique textbook.&#8221; <b>Susan Sandring December 2009</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The year 2008 marked the 150th anniversary of the publication of Gray&#8217;s Anatomy. It has been published continuously throughout this century and a half and has been the bible to which all medical students and doctors have turned for instruction and enlightenment.&#8221; <b>Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, July 2009</b></p>

Specialty Colleges and RACP teach a clinical skills subject in the early part of basic training which takes place after PGY1 &amp; 2.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A classic text, <b>Chamberlain&#8217;s Symptoms and Signs in Clinical Medicine</b> has been providing students and professionals with a detailed and well-illustrated account of the symptoms and signs of diseases affecting all the body systems since the first edition published in 1936. Now completely rewritten by a new team of authors selected for their experience and reputation in writing quality publications in their specialist fields, the 13th edition brings the title into line with current teaching and practice.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges of writing a textbook of diagnostic medicine is to balance the &#8220;bottom up&#8221; approach of constructing a differential diagnosis from individual clinical findings, and the &#8220;top down&#8221; approach of learning the key features pertaining to a particular diagnosis. The 13th edition of <b>Chamberlain&#8217;s Symptoms and Signs in Clinical Medicine</b> integrates both approaches into a coherent working framework that will assist the reader in preparing for academic and professional examinations, and in everyday practice.</p>
<p>Presented in full colour and illustrated with relevant images, this book provides a thorough lesson in diagnostic medicine, ensuring the reader is fully prepared to deal with the challenging process of differential diagnosis through a thorough knowledge of the central features of the conditions that they are likely to encounter.</p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaches the reader how to diagnose correctly through assessment of symptoms and signs while simultaneously recalling all key features of a given condition</li>
<li>Full colour and generously illustrated</li>
<li>Conforms with the core competencies required for the foundation years</li>
<li>Includes bullet point lists and tip boxes</li>
<li>Chapters conclude with a summary of key points for easy revision</li>
<li>Written and edited by a highly experienced team of specialists</li>
<li>Companion website</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This best-selling undergraduate textbook provides an introduction to key experimental techniques from across the biosciences. It uniquely integrates the theories and practices that drive the fields of biology and medicine, comprehensively covering both the methods students will encounter in lab classes and those that underpin recent advances and discoveries. Its problem-solving approach continues with worked examples that set a challenge and then show students how the challenge is met. New to this edition are case studies, for example, that illustrate the relevance of the principles and techniques to the diagnosis and treatment of individual patients. Coverage is expanded to include a section on stem cells, chapters on immunochemical techniques and spectroscopy techniques, and additional chapters on drug discovery and development, and clinical biochemistry. Experimental design and the statistical analysis of data are emphasised throughout to ensure students are equipped to successfully plan their own experiments and examine the results obtained.</p>
