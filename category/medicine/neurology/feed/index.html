				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-title entry-title">Now in its 5th edition,<em> Escourolle and Poirier Manual of Basic Neuropathology</em> continues the tradition of being one of the most respected texts in neuropathology by providing an introduction to the various diseases of the nervous system and their underlying pathology. This thorough, yet concise manual covers the full spectrum of the various categories of neurologic disease, including neoplasia, trauma, vascular disease, and infection, with separate chapters on prion diseases, multiple sclerosis, degenerative disorders, acquired metabolic diseases, hereditary metabolic diseases, congenital malformations, perinatal diseases, skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve, and the pituitary gland. To accurately guide the clinician, the most current techniques in neuropathology are covered in their own chapter at the end of the book. Richly illustrated throughout, with over 700 images of various neuropathogical diagnoses such as tumor, stroke, infection, degeneration, and malformation among others, this new edition of the classic monograph is an easy-to-use manual for any student, researcher, or practitioner seeking basic information on neuropathology.<br />
Used for decades in all fields related to the nervous system-including neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, neuroradiology, neuroendocrinology, neuropathology, pathology, and neuroscience-<em>Escourolle and Poirier Manual of Basic Neuropathology</em> is regarded at the &#8216;bible&#8217; of neuropathology. This new version has been completely rewritten and expanded to include important updates in genetics and molecular biology, reflective of the important neuropathological discoveries in those fields over the past decade.This book is a practical diagnostic tool and necessary reading for anyone encountering pathological conditions of the nervous system.</p>
