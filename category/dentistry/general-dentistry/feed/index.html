				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A market-leading dental anatomy textbook for dental, dental hygiene, and dental assisting students, <b>Woelfel&#8217;s Dental Anatomy</b> focuses on anatomy of the human mouth and teeth, and is designed to help the student understand the relationship of the teeth to one another, and to the bones, muscles, nerves, and vessels associated with the teeth and face. This text does more than simply explain dental anatomy; it links the anatomy to clinical practice, giving readers a stronger and more practical understanding of tooth structure and function, morphology, anatomy, and terminology. Chapters have been revised and reorganized into three parts—Comparative Tooth Anatomy, Application of Tooth Anatomy in Dental Practice, and Anatomic Structures of the Oral Cavity—to make the material more accessible to dental hygiene programs.</p>
<p>The companion website offers Student Resources for an enhanced learning experience with an interactive image bank, image labeling exercises, and PowerPoint presentations. Instructor Resources include a test generator, an interactive image bank, PowerPoint presentations, and answers to the book&#8217;s critical thinking questions.</p>
