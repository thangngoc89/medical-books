				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;In short, the 40th edition of <b><i>Gray&#8217;s Anatomy</i></b> is not only the most complete textbook of anatomy on the market but is possibly the most complete anatomical atlas available.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>JAMA</b></i>, May 6, 2009&#8211;Vol 301, No. 17, pp. 1829-1830.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not aware of any book currently in print in any language that contains as much anatomical information as the 40th edition. it should be in the library of anyone who has the need for a comprehensive anatomical reference book. It may seem costly, but, per pound, it really is a bargain. Many books on the market offer much, much less but cost much more.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>JAMA</b></i>, May 6, 2009&#8211;Vol 301, No. 17, pp. 1829-1830.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most valuable aspects of <b><i>Gray&#8217;s</i></b> is the way it integrates structure at all levels, from the subcellular through the regional.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>JAMA</b></i>, May 6, 2009&#8211;Vol 301, No. 17, pp. 1829-1830.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Gray&#8217;s Anatomy] is to medical textbooks what Webster&#8217;s is to dictionaries.&#8221; &#8211;<i><b>American Medical News</b></i>, Posted Jan. 12, 2009 at amednews.com &#8220;Each section has been reorganized by an editor, expert in the field, assisted by a group of contributors, and scrutinized by a panel of international reviewers. Anatomists, embryologists, cell biologists, surgeons, radiologists and other clinicians have brought their extensive experience to update the text and artwork. Moreover, essential and recent references are given at the end of each chapter of the different sections. The result is a well-documented and clinically-oriented state-of-the-art volume&#8230;The presentation of the book is practical and attractive&#8230;To sum up, this new 150th anniversary edition of <i>Gray’s Anatomy</i>, which is the first one in full-colour, is quite simply a magnificent work.&#8221; <b><i>Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy, November 2008</i></b> &#8220;The all-important tradition of improvement with age is most emphatically maintained by the newest edition of Gray&#8217;s Anatomy . . . New and important ground has been broken . . . The authors have increasingly taken on the task of accommodating the new uses to which anatomy is being put in clinical situations, such as minimally invasive surgery, endoscopy, arthroscopy, microsurgery, and the entire expanding field of imaging, including three-dimensional studies . . . Beautifully produced and medically invaluable.&#8221; &#8211; Scientific American, review of the 39th edition Gray’s Anatomy has been around since 1858. In 2008, Elsevier can be proud of the first class presentation of this updated, fabulous book. It has been completely re-imagined with re-organised contents and 1800 images now in full-colour, in addition to more than 120 new imaging studies. For those who need a detailed anatomy reference, this book is the business and it’s the only one you’ll ever need. <b>Unividas Review, January 2009</b></p>
<p>&#8220;This book has really excellent content. It’s the first point of call for a query, better than standard textbooks. Good authorage and editorial input is evident. A new edition of Gray’s always has to live up to its historical place in the medical world. The new edition updates content, is well presented, readable and accurate. This is supported by quality illustrations. A book for those wanting a reference source for anatomy which is reliable and current.&#8221; <i><b>BMA Book Awards 2009 &#8211; judges comments</b></i></p>
<p>&#8220;The new edition of Gray’s Anatomy has been edited by a highly regarded group of clinicians and anatomists, with support from hundreds of contributors and specialist reviewers worldwide. The reader gets enhanced and updated artwork throughout the text’s 2,000 images that utilise full colour and provide a consistent, coherent view of every anatomical detail. It provides every practitioner with the best, most clinically helpful, visual understanding of the subject available. It was a pleasure to review this exceptional and unique textbook.&#8221; <b>Susan Sandring December 2009</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The year 2008 marked the 150th anniversary of the publication of Gray&#8217;s Anatomy. It has been published continuously throughout this century and a half and has been the bible to which all medical students and doctors have turned for instruction and enlightenment.&#8221; <b>Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, July 2009</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A market-leading dental anatomy textbook for dental, dental hygiene, and dental assisting students, <b>Woelfel&#8217;s Dental Anatomy</b> focuses on anatomy of the human mouth and teeth, and is designed to help the student understand the relationship of the teeth to one another, and to the bones, muscles, nerves, and vessels associated with the teeth and face. This text does more than simply explain dental anatomy; it links the anatomy to clinical practice, giving readers a stronger and more practical understanding of tooth structure and function, morphology, anatomy, and terminology. Chapters have been revised and reorganized into three parts—Comparative Tooth Anatomy, Application of Tooth Anatomy in Dental Practice, and Anatomic Structures of the Oral Cavity—to make the material more accessible to dental hygiene programs.</p>
<p>The companion website offers Student Resources for an enhanced learning experience with an interactive image bank, image labeling exercises, and PowerPoint presentations. Instructor Resources include a test generator, an interactive image bank, PowerPoint presentations, and answers to the book&#8217;s critical thinking questions.</p>
