				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This CD-ROM provides an interactive database of human anatomy, with the emphasis on clinical and functional relevance. Based on the texts &#8220;Colour Atlas of Human Anatomy&#8221; and &#8220;Functional and Clinical Anatomy&#8221;, it illustrates key functions by using video clips and animated graphics. Some features of anatomy, such as the skeleton and other parts of the body, are included in 3-D by MRI; and anatomy can be studied by system or region, or both, in this interactive programme. Interactive tests are included for all stills in the programme, as well as Peter Abraham&#8217;s Cambridge anatomy worksheets, which include core questions on every region of the body. There is a zoom facility for close study and highlighting interesting structures.</p>

<p>Solutions to common problems:<br />
README for McMinn\&#8217;s 3-D Anatomy<br />
Listed below are solutions to known problems which may occur<br />
installing or running the application.</p>
<p>(REF: LOWCLR)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: The installation displays a warning that the<br />
application may not run correctly using the current display<br />
settings.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This application requires that your display settings<br />
are set to at least 800 x 600 and with more than 256 colors. To<br />
change these settings on your machine proceed as follows:</p>
<p>From the Start button, choose &#8220;Settings&#8221; and &#8220;Control Panel&#8221;.<br />
This will bring up a list of controls, from which you should<br />
choose the &#8220;Display&#8221; option. This brings up the Display<br />
Properties panel. Click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab to show the<br />
current settings for the numbers of colours, desktop size and<br />
font size. Ensure the &#8220;Color Palette&#8221; setting is set to a value<br />
greater than 256 (eg. &#8220;65536 colors&#8221;, &#8220;High Color&#8221;, &#8220;16 bit&#8221; or<br />
&#8220;True Color&#8221;. Use the &#8220;Desktop Area&#8221; slider to ensure that it<br />
is set to at least &#8220;800 by 600 pixels&#8221;. You can use the &#8220;Test&#8221;<br />
button to check your selection. Click on &#8220;Close&#8221; when you have<br />
finished.</p>
<p>(REF: ADMPRIV)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: The installation displays a message indicating<br />
&#8220;administrator privileges&#8221; are required.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: The installer has to make changes to the system which,<br />
when running under Windows NT, can only be made by a user with<br />
administrator privileges. The installer must be run again when a<br />
user with administrator privileges is logged-on. Once installed<br />
the application can be used by any user.</p>
<p>(REF: COMCTRL)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: When the application is run it displays a warning that<br />
a system update is required.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This application requires a recent version of a<br />
Microsoft system file called &#8220;Comctl32.dll&#8221; to be installed. The<br />
installer checks for this file and should prompt the user to<br />
install the &#8220;COMCTL32.DLL&#8221; update. However if for any reason the<br />
user skipped this part of the installation or it did not<br />
complete correctly then it can be installed manually.</p>
<p>The update can be installed either by installing a recent<br />
version of Microsoft Internet Explorer (4.01 SP2 or later) or by<br />
running the Microsoft update program &#8220;401comupd.exe&#8221; which is<br />
supplied with this application.</p>
<p>To run the update program:</p>
<p>* Ensure the application CDROM is in the drive.</p>
<p>* Close the application if it is already running.</p>
<p>* From the &#8220;Start&#8221; button menu, select &#8220;Run&#8230;&#8221; and type<br />
&#8220;\\setup\\401cmupd.exe&#8221; and press RETURN (assuming D is your<br />
CD-ROM drive). Follow the on-screen instructions to install the<br />
update.</p>
<p>Below are the notes supplied by Microsoft for running this<br />
update:</p>
<p>You can use the file 401comupd.exe to install Comctl32.dll<br />
(version 4.72.3611.1900) on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows<br />
NT 4.0. You cannot use 401comupd.exe for Windows 3.x, Windows<br />
for Workgroups 3.x, Windows NT 3.x, Windows 98 SE, or Windows<br />
2000. Do not attempt to run 401comupd.exe on any system with<br />
Internet Explorer 5.x installed. You must install Service Pack 3<br />
or later on Windows NT 4.0 before installing 401comupd.exe. As<br />
with all operating system changes, administrator privileges are<br />
required to use 401comupd.exe on Windows NT 4.0.</p>
<p>(note that the file 401comupd.exe has been renamed to<br />
401cmupd.exe on the CD because of filename restrictions)</p>
<p>At the time of writing the latest version of this update is<br />
available for download at<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp.</p>
<p>(REF: NTSP3)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: I\&#8217;m running Windows NT 4 and the installation fails<br />
with a message indicating that I need to install &#8220;Service Pack<br />
3&#8221;.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This application will only run on Windows NT 4 if<br />
Service Pack 3 or later has been installed.</p>
<p>Please contact Microsoft to obtain the latest Service Pack. This<br />
can usually be downloaded free of charge from their web site.<br />
Some computer magazines also supply it on their cover-mounted<br />
CDs.</p>
<p>(REF: APPSETUP)</p>
<p>PROBLEM: When the application is run it displays a message<br />
indicating it cannot find a file called &#8220;appsetup.txt&#8221;.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This indicates that for some reason the application<br />
data files (which normally reside on the supplied CD) cannot be<br />
accessed. This could occur if the CD is not in the drive or if<br />
the drive letter of the CD drive has changed since the<br />
application was last run.</p>
<p>Click on &#8220;OK&#8221; to dismiss this message and a window is displayed<br />
which will allow the location of the file to be selected.<br />
Navigate to the folder containing &#8220;appsetup.txt&#8221; and click OK.<br />
Note that the &#8220;appsetup.txt&#8221; file is normally within a folder<br />
called &#8220;shared&#8221;.</p>
