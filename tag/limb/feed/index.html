				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Basic Science and Systemic Disease</i></b>, <b>Part 3</b> of <b><i>The Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations:</i><i>Musculoskeletal System, 2nd Edition</i></b><i>, </i>provides a<b> highly visual guide </b>to this body system, from foundational basic science and anatomy to orthopaedics and rheumatology. This spectacularly illustrated volume in the masterwork known as the (CIBA) &#8220;Green Books&#8221; has been expanded and revised by Dr. Joseph Iannotti, Dr. Richard Parker, and other experts from the Cleveland Clinic to mirror the many exciting advances in musculoskeletal medicine and imaging &#8211; offering <b>rich insights</b> into embryology; physiology; metabolic disorders; congenital and development disorders; rheumatic diseases; tumors of musculoskeletal system; injury to musculoskeletal system; soft tissue infections; and fracture complications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Get complete, integrated visual guidance on the musculoskeletal system</b> with thorough, richly illustrated coverage.</li>
<li><b>Quickly understand complex topics</b> thanks to a concise text-atlas format that provides a context bridge between primary and specialized medicine.</li>
<li><b>Clearly visualize</b> how core concepts of anatomy, physiology, and other basic sciences correlate across disciplines.</li>
<li><b>Benefit from matchless Netter illustrations</b> that offer precision, clarity, detail and realism as they provide a visual approach to the clinical presentation and care of the patient.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gain a rich clinical view </b>of embryology; physiology; metabolic disorders; congenital and development disorders; rheumatic diseases; tumors of musculoskeletal system; injury to musculoskeletal system; soft tissue infections; and fracture complications in one comprehensive volume, conveyed through beautiful illustrations as well as up-to-date radiologic and laparoscopic images.</li>
<li><b>Benefit from the expertise of Drs. Joseph Iannotti, Richard Parker</b>, and esteemed colleagues from the<b>Cleveland Clinic</b>, who clarify and expand on the illustrated concepts.</li>
<li><b>Clearly see the connection between basic science and clinical practice</b> with an integrated overview of normal structure and function as it relates to pathologic conditions.</li>
<li><b>See current clinical concepts in orthopaedics and rheumatology</b> captured in classic Netter illustrations, as well as new illustrations created specifically for this volume by artist-physician Carlos Machado, MD, and others working in the Netter style.</li>
