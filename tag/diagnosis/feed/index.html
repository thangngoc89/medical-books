<p>The book is written for the clinical skills subject of the medical curriculum. Medical schools teach this at varying stages, some introducing the subject in the beginning years (graduate medical schools years 1 &amp; 2) and others at year 3 (traditional/hybrid curricula, usually 5 or 6 years). Specialty Colleges and RACP teach a clinical skills subject in the early part of basic training which takes place after PGY1 &amp; 2.</p>
