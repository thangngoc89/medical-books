				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Integumentary System, by Bryan E. Anderson, MD, takes a concise and highly visual approach to illustrate the basic sciences and clinical pathology of the skin, hair and nails. This newly added, never-before-published volume in The Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations (formerly the CIBA &#8220;Green Books&#8221;) captures current clinical perspectives on the integumentary system &#8211; from normal anatomy and histology to pathology, dermatology, and common issues in plastic surgery and wound healing. Using classic Netter illustrations and new illustrations created in the Netter tradition, as well as a great many cutting-edge histologic micrographs and diagnostic images, it provides a vivid, illuminating, and clinically indispensable view of this body system.</p>

<li>See current dermatologic concepts captured in the visually rich Netter artistic tradition via major new contributions from Netter disciple Carlos Machado, MD &#8211; making complex concepts easy to understand and remember through the precision, clarity, detail, and realism for which Netter’s work has always been known.</li>
</ul>
