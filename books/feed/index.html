				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology 5th edition, by Valerie C. Scanlon and Sanders describes the anatomical place verbally by utilizing correct anatomical terminology to describe body directions, surfaces, and body planes. It locates the key body cavities and records the chief organs in each cavity. This book defines its role in maintaining homeostasis and normal body perform with listing features that humans must perform to take care of life. The study instruments include histology overview, bone review, muscle evaluation, labeling actions, interactive flashcards, a glossary, crossword puzzles, scientific circumstances, and net links. Authors explain the relationship between anatomy and physiology, and describe varied specialties of each discipline, establish the main ranges of group in dwelling organisms and eleven organ methods of the human physique and the main parts of each system. They describe the components and main capabilities of blood, and record the physical traits of blood. This book gives every main section to make sure that students have understood the material and its corresponding Studying Consequence before they move on to the following major section. New visually based end-of-chapter questions are added with the visible orientation of the book and check college students&#8217; visual understanding of key information and concepts. Authors also describe the features of the plasma membrane and the buildings that allow it to perform these functions. The carrier-mediated transport and vesicular transport mechanisms are explained which cells use to soak up or remove particular substances. The Take a look at Bank and the online quizzes and exams at the moment are also organized by the chapter Learning Outcomes, making pupil evaluation simple for instructors</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated and revised to reflect recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances, this popular quick reference guide provides the practical knowledge needed to diagnose and manage children with congenital and acquired heart disease. It explains whether the patient should be referred to a pediatric cardiologist or managed by the primary care practitioner. It also features the latest blood pressure measuring techniques, new recommendations by the National Committee on infective endocarditis prophylaxis, cardiovascular manifestations of HIV infection, and includes pediatric drug dosage tables.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This is a wonderful and extremely useful teaching guide and clinical tool&#8230;surpasses all other books on this topic in its goal of providing practical information to primary care practitioners. The new edition is justified for many reasons. Surgical techniques have changed since the last edition, and Dr. Park has updated this section extensively. The treatment of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension has also been updated nicely. The new chapters on palpitations and athletes with cardiac problems are also extremely useful. The updates, as well as Dr. Park&#8217;s personal and logical advice on topics such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, make this book the logical resource for primary care clinicians</p>
