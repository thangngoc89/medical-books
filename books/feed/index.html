				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated and revised to reflect recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances, this popular quick reference guide provides the practical knowledge needed to diagnose and manage children with congenital and acquired heart disease. It explains whether the patient should be referred to a pediatric cardiologist or managed by the primary care practitioner. It also features the latest blood pressure measuring techniques, new recommendations by the National Committee on infective endocarditis prophylaxis, cardiovascular manifestations of HIV infection, and includes pediatric drug dosage tables.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This is a wonderful and extremely useful teaching guide and clinical tool&#8230;surpasses all other books on this topic in its goal of providing practical information to primary care practitioners. The new edition is justified for many reasons. Surgical techniques have changed since the last edition, and Dr. Park has updated this section extensively. The treatment of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension has also been updated nicely. The new chapters on palpitations and athletes with cardiac problems are also extremely useful. The updates, as well as Dr. Park&#8217;s personal and logical advice on topics such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, make this book the logical resource for primary care clinicians</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The growth of implant and fixed prosthodontics practices in dentistry has created a rapidly increasing demand for advanced ceramics and ceramic processes. Innovations in ceramics and ceramic processes are vital to ensure reliable and affordable dental-restoration solutions with aesthetically pleasing outcomes.</p>
<p>The work aims to engage the bioceramics and engineering communities to meet the challenges of modern dental restoration using advanced ceramics. Incorporating fundamental science, advanced engineering concepts, and clinical outcomes, the work is suitable for bioceramicists, ceramics manufacturers, dental clinicians and biologists.</p>
<ul>
<li>State-of-the-art-coverage encompasses bioresorbable ceramics for bone regeneration and bioactivating surfaces of inert, high-strength ceramics for implantation, keeping research knowledge appropriately updated</li>
<li>Discusses transition from the baseline stable and physically stiff ceramics research into engineering of highly coherent laminate composites for prosthetic crowns and bridges</li>
<li>Showcases current feasible techniques for producing, in cost-effective and materials-saving ways, long-lasting individualized ceramic components with biocompatibility, complexity and high precision</li>
</ul>
